# 🚀 Bharath — Building at the Frontier of Science & Intelligence

Hi! I'm **Bharath** — a physicist, data scientist, mathematician, AI researcher, and founder-minded builder.
I turn **ideas → systems → products**, blending rigorous science with engineering pragmatism.

### 🌌 What I Do

* **AI Systems & Agents** — LLM-based autonomous systems, retrieval architecture, optimization.
* **Scientific Computing** — numerical physics, high-dimensional modeling, simulation.
* **Machine Learning Research** — representation learning, generative models, algorithm design.
* **Entrepreneurial Engineering** — transforming scientific insights into real, usable products.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus

* **Grasper AI** — an autonomous data-analyst agent with code generation, scraping, and visualization.
* **Kernel Engineering** — custom Android/Linux kernel builds (GKI, Clang toolchains, SFS, KSU).
* **Applied ML** — computer vision, freshness detection (fruits/vegetables), structured prediction.
* **RAG Systems** — context-aware FastAPI microservices with Typesense, OpenAI embeddings, and hybrid search.
